# Exercise: Boolean Operators 4
Try to solve on paper the following boolean algebra operations:
* [A]: considering that `a=1`, `b=3`, `c=a*b`, `d=c`: `(d / c + 2) >= b || !(c + b - c / a == 3)`
* [B]: considering that `x=5`, `y=6`, `t=false` and `f=true`: `(x * x - y * y / 2 != 12) || !t && f`

Then compare your solutions with a Java program that tests the validity of your assumptions.
